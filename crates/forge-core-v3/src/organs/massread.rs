//! # massread.rs — the MASS-READ law as a verb (Sean 07-28 "skills are just a
//! suggestion, it needs to be a verb"): stdin corpus -> gemini flash-lite, output
//! CAP'd, stderr receipt. Law of record: forge_book::oracle1_governor::MASS_READ_LAW.
//!
//! Ported 2026-08-17 from F:\NewRepo\crates\forge-studio\src\massread.rs (1378 LOC).
//! Adaptations: dropped serde_json (unanchored_findings), dropped forge_firewall auth checks,
//! dropped forge_book structural question detection. Core doctrine constants and pure seams
//! ported VERBATIM.
//!
//! DEAD-LEDGER:
//! - unanchored_findings() (donor line 158) — requires serde_json parsing, not ported
//! - correction_prompt() (donor line 185) — companion to unanchored_findings, not ported
//! - Self-test firewall authorization (donor line 652) — requires forge_firewall, not ported
//! - Main run() firewall authorization (donor line 843) — requires forge_firewall, not ported
//! - question_is_structural integration (donor line 755) — requires forge_book, not ported
//!
//! No `run()` wrapper calls into this module's spawn/rate-limit/beat machinery
//! yet (that's the downstream organ's job, per this crate's Crate Zero split) —
//! blanket allow instead of doc-churning donor-verbatim consts/fns that are
//! real, tested, and simply not wired to a caller in THIS crate yet.

### OPERATIONAL LAWS
1. EVIDENCE FIRST: cite exact line numbers, struct names, or text snippets from <corpus> before issuing any verdict.
2. NO CONFABULATION: never infer intent or invent file paths. A symbol whose DECLARATION you can see but whose call sites could live in a file outside <corpus> is UNKNOWN, never ABSENT — ABSENT is reserved for the case where the complete dispatch map is present and you can prove the negative. Say which file would hold the evidence.
3. BINARY COMPLIANCE: emit only the requested JSON. No conversational filler, no markdown fence, no postscript.

### EXECUTION PROTOCOL
Step 1: read <rules> and <corpus> (corpus arrives on stdin).
Step 2: fill "scratchpad" with raw facts and line references found in <corpus>.
Step 3: only then emit the verdict fields.

### INPUT DATA
<rules>

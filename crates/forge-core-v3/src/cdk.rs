//! CDK — the Cosmic Dissonance Kernel, `Triad` only.
//!
//! Ported 2026-08-13 from `F:\NewRepo\crates\forge-game-systems\src\cdk.rs:14-136`
//! (census.tsv `forge-game-systems` row, GAME-SYSTEMS-CENSUS-2026-08-11.md:88-90).
//! Empedocles made mechanical: LOVE binds, STRIFE separates, ENTROPY is what neither
//! holds. Integer-only in the v2 source and here — the donor's own doc comment: "a
//! float here would put a non-deterministic edge on the 120Hz tick".
//!
//! **Scope cut, stated plainly (C09 aperture):** the v2 file is 503 lines and only
//! `Triad` itself (its fields, `disposition`/`harmony`/`dissonant`/`to_channels`, and
//! the private `norm_signed` helper) is self-contained. Everything else in the donor —
//! `triad()`/`triad_from_fields()` (need `FactionMind`, `Cell`, `forge_zones`,
//! `forge_calligraphy`), `to_vibe_signals`/`to_vibe` (need `forge_core::vibe_matrix`),
//! `TriadHold` (wall-clock crossing, needs a clock bridge), `room_frame`/`tone_of_triad`
//! (need `forge_hal::TripleBuffer`, `forge_sieve::prime_seed`, `forge_calligraphy::
//! audio_bridge`) — none of those crates/types exist in v3 yet. Porting them now would
//! be scaffolding against nothing; this file ports only what has no dangling reference.
//!
//! **CORRECTED (2026-08-13):** the assumption below was live for under a day.
//! `FactionMind` was never missing from v3 — it was already landed in
//! `forge-mud-v3::mind.rs` (8-axis, 5 authored factions), and that crate had
//! independently re-derived its OWN second `Triad` plus a real `triad()`
//! dealer, `colour()`, `bar()`, `report()` (`forge-mud-v3::cdk.rs`) — an L05
//! violation caught by a lateral-criticality pass, not by re-reading this
//! note. Fixed by making `forge_mud_v3::cdk` import `Triad` from HERE
//! (`pub use forge_core_v3::cdk::Triad;` — `forge-mud-v3` already depends on
//! `forge-core-v3`, the correct direction per L06 `dag_root`) and keep only
//! the `FactionMind`-dependent dealer + rendering fns downstream, where
//! `FactionMind` correctly lives (faction cognition is MUD-domain, not
//! core-domain — it does not belong in this crate). `Cell`/`forge_zones`/
//! `forge_calligraphy`/`forge_hal::TripleBuffer`/`forge_sieve::prime_seed`
//! remain genuinely absent from v3 as of this correction — `to_vibe_signals`/
//! `TriadHold`/`room_frame`/`tone_of_triad` stay unported for that reason,
//! unchanged from the original note.
//!
//! Assumes: `Triad` alone is useful without a dealer function IN THIS CRATE.
//! Proven true: the dealer exists, one level downstream, exactly where its
//! one real dependency (`FactionMind`) already lived.

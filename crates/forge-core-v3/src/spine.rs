//! The spine — provenance, commit class, and the lock verdict.
//!
//! Every artifact that enters the deterministic fabric is wrapped in an
//! [`AuthorityTicket`] declaring (a) what it is ([`CarrierKind`]), (b) where it
//! came from ([`SourceKind`]), (c) what receipt is being issued
//! ([`ReceiptKind`]), and (d) the lineage chain via [`CarrierHeader`].
//!
//! Discriminants are stable and are **const-asserted below**. Reordering a
//! variant breaks replay, so it breaks `cargo check` first; only append new
//! variants at the end.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent, and why
//!
//! This crate has zero dependencies (`Cargo.toml:9-11`) and blake3 in particular
//! is firewalled out of it — BLAKE3 lives downstream in `forge-vcs-v3`. Two
//! names therefore arrive here with a hole in them, and the hole is the point:
//!
//! - [`BrutalHash`] is the 64-bit **carrier** of a truncated blake3 digest. It
//!   has `ZERO` and `as_u64` but **no `of()`** and no `combine()`; both hash.
//!   The type crosses the firewall, the hashing does not.
//! - [`AuthorityTicket`] has **no `deterministic_hash`**. Its final act was
//!   `BrutalHash::of(&buf)`, so it is a blake3 call wearing a serialization
//!   coat. It belongs to `forge-vcs-v3` alongside `mint()`.
//!
//! Two further omissions from the ported sources, recorded so their absence
//! reads as a decision rather than an oversight: `Trit::rgb` and its `AnsiEmit`
//! impl needed a `provenance` module that does not exist here, and the ledger
//! helper `append_global` does not port at all — the VCS is the ledger.
